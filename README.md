# Cosmos Cassandra Stress
CosmosCassandraStress is a tool to scale test the Cassandra API at very large throughput. It is to be observed that even at very large request volume, the latency stays significantly constant.

# Steps to run

## 1. Create Tables in the Cosmos Cassandra account (Keyspace is "loadtest")

    CREATE TABLE loadtest.raw_price_data (
      product_id text,
      timestamp timestamp,
      visible boolean,
      price double,
      warehouse_id bigint,
      seller_id int,
      PRIMARY KEY (product_id, timestamp)
    ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (timestamp ASC)
    AND cosmosdb_provisioned_throughput = 1000000; // You could modify the throughput to be lower as well


    CREATE TABLE loadtest.daily_max_price_data (
        product_id text,
        date text,
        price double,
        warehouse_id bigint,
        timestamp timestamp,
        PRIMARY KEY (product_id, date)
    ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (date ASC)
      AND cosmosdb_cell_level_timestamp = true
    AND cosmosdb_provisioned_throughput = 1000000; // You could modify the throughput to be lower as well

## 2. Build from Sources

### 2a. For logging latencies onto AppInsights: (Optional)
     - Create an AppInsights account in Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com)
     - Get the "Instrumentation key" from "Overview page"
     - Add the key to the sources in "CassandraStrss.java": runLoadTest()
       -- TelemetryConfiguration.getActive().setInstrumentationKey("<Set your Instrumentation key here>");

### 2b. Quickly run the available jar (Please keep in mind that, using this option AppInsights logs are not available to you to check latency numbers)

Linux fat jar available here: https://cosmoscassandra.blob.core.windows.net/cassandrastress/CosmosCassandra-Linux-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

    \target > java -cp CosmosCassandra-Linux-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.microsoft.cosmos.cassandrastress.CassandraStress --endpoint <Cosmos Cassandra Account Name>.cassandra.cosmosdb.azure.com --key <Primary Key from Azure Portal> --username <Username from Azure Portal> --keyspace loadtest --tablename raw_price_data --operation get_ids -mode write_mode
 

# Quick Troubleshooting:
1. The built jar in \target runs in Windows without any changes. For running in Linux the following change needs to be made in    CassandraStress.java:

       ssl_keystore_file_path = new StringBuilder(javaHomeDirectory).append("/jre/lib/security/cacerts").toString();
                
   This change owes to difference in path of "cacerts" file for Java in Windows\Linux:
   
       Linux: $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
       Windows: $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts
